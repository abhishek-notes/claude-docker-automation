# FINAL SOLUTION - Official Claude Code Pattern

## The Real Issue
Claude Code wasn't persisting its configuration because we weren't using the correct Docker volume pattern that Claude expects.

## The Solution - `claude-official.sh`

Based on the official Claude Code devcontainer, the key insight is:
1. Use a **named Docker volume** for `/home/claude/.claude` (not bind mounts)
2. Set proper environment variables: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/claude/.claude`
3. Let Claude handle its own configuration persistence

## How to Test

### 1. Build the Image (Done)
```bash
# Already built: claude-automation:latest
docker images | grep claude-automation
```

### 2. First Run - Will Do Setup Once
```bash
./claude-official.sh start /Users/abhishek/Work/coin-flip-app
```

Expected on first run:
- Claude will ask for theme selection (choose dark)
- Claude will handle authentication setup
- This creates persistent volume `claude-code-config`

### 3. Second Run - Should Skip Setup
```bash
# Exit first session and run again
./claude-official.sh start /Users/abhishek/Work/coin-flip-app
```

Expected on second run:
- **NO theme selection**
- **NO authentication prompts**
- **Direct to Claude interface**

### 4. Verify Persistence
```bash
./claude-official.sh info
```

Should show:
- Volume exists with configuration files
- Authentication file present

## Key Differences from Previous Attempts

1. **Named Volume**: Uses `claude-code-config` volume, not bind mounts
2. **Correct Path**: Mounts to `/home/claude/.claude` exactly as Claude expects
3. **Environment**: Sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/claude/.claude`
4. **Ownership**: Ensures proper file ownership inside container

## The Volume Strategy

```bash
# The volume contains:
/home/claude/.claude/
├── .claude.json      # Authentication
├── settings/         # User preferences  
├── config/          # Application config
└── state/           # Session state
```

This persists between container runs, so Claude "remembers" its setup.

## Commands

```bash
# Start session (main command)
./claude-official.sh start /path/to/project

# Check volume status
./claude-official.sh info

# Reset if needed
./claude-official.sh reset

# Help
./claude-official.sh help
```

## Expected Results

First run: Setup prompts (one time only)
Subsequent runs: Direct to Claude, no prompts

This should FINALLY solve the persistent setup issue by following the exact pattern Claude Code expects for Docker environments.
