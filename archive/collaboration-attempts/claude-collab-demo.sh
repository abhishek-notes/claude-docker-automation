    cat << 'EOF'
Claude Alice: I'm analyzing the Medusa backend. I found an interesting pattern 
              in the Salesforce integration. The sync happens in subscribers - 
              should this be moved to workflows for better error handling?

Claude Bob:   Good question! I'm seeing the frontend expects real-time updates. 
              The current subscriber pattern works but workflows would give us 
              better retry logic. What's the current failure rate?

Claude Alice: Looking at logs now... Found 3% failure rate on customer sync. 
              Workflows with proper error handling could reduce this.

Claude Bob:   Agreed. I can update the frontend to handle async workflows. 
              Should we implement a job queue for reliability?

Claude Alice: Found potential security issue in API endpoint:
              /api/admin/salesforce-test/route.ts line 23
              Missing authentication check before Salesforce data access.

Claude Bob:   Confirmed. I see the frontend doesn't handle auth errors properly 
              either. Let me check the auth flow... 
              Frontend assumes user is always authenticated.

Claude Alice: I'll add proper middleware authentication.
              Can you add error handling for 401/403 responses?

Claude Bob:   On it! I'll also add loading states for better UX.

Claude Alice: The Medusa-Salesforce sync is failing for products with 
              custom attributes. Error in salesforce.ts:145

Claude Bob:   I can see why - the frontend sends nested objects but 
              Salesforce expects flat structure. 
              Check the product form in components/ProductForm.tsx

Claude Alice: Found it! The form nests color/variant data. 
              I'll add a transformer function in the sync service.

Claude Bob:   Perfect! I'll update the form to match the expected structure.
              This should fix the sync issues.

üéØ COLLABORATION APPROACHES

1. FILE-BASED COLLABORATION
   - Communication via shared markdown files
   - Question/answer format
   - Good for: Sequential tasks, documentation
   - Setup: ./claude-collaborative.sh

2. REAL-TIME COLLABORATION  
   - Live messaging between instances
   - Web dashboard monitoring
   - Shared state management
   - Good for: Complex analysis, coordination
   - Setup: ./claude-realtime-collab.sh

üõ†Ô∏è SETUP COMMANDS

File-based:
  ./claude-collaborative.sh setup /tmp/workspace
  ./claude-collaborative.sh start-pair /path/to/project

Real-time:
  ./claude-realtime-collab.sh start-pair /path/to/project

ü§ù COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS

Communication Structure:
- Clear question/response format
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Update status regularly
- Share relevant code snippets

Message Types:
- question: Ask for help or clarification
- finding: Share discovery or insight  
- suggestion: Propose improvement
- status: Update current task progress

üîß MONITORING & MANAGEMENT

File-based monitoring:
  ./claude-collaborative.sh monitor /workspace
  ./claude-collaborative.sh status

Real-time monitoring:
  Open http://localhost:8080
  View live dashboard

Cleanup:
  ./claude-collaborative.sh cleanup
  docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter name=claude-collab)

üéØ BEST PRACTICES

1. Define clear roles for each instance
2. Establish communication protocols early
3. Use specific, actionable questions
4. Reference code with file:line format
5. Update status regularly
6. Share findings and coordinate solutions

üöÄ ADVANCED FEATURES

- Multiple instance coordination (3+ Claude instances)
- Integration with external tools (ChatGPT, Google AI)
- Apple Script automation for response passing
- Custom collaboration workflows
- Team development integration
