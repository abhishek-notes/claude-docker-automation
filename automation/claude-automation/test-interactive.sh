   - List all available servers

2. **Create Test Files**
   - Create a file: SETUP_TEST.md
   - Add the current date and time
   - List the MCP servers you found
   - Note if filesystem MCP is working

3. **Test File Operations**
   - Create a directory: test-results
   - Create a file in it: test-results/timestamp.txt
