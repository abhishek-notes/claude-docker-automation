# Task Instructions for Claude Code

## Project Context
- Repository: Claude Automation Testing
- Working Directory: /Users/abhishek/Work/claude-automation
- Goal: Test the automation system

## Today's Tasks

1. **Test MCP Servers**
   - Requirements: 
     - Run `/mcp` to list MCP servers
     - Test filesystem operations
     - Document which servers are working
   - Expected outcome: 
     - List of active MCP servers
     - Successful file operations
   - Time estimate: 15 minutes

2. **Create Test Files**
   - Requirements:
     - Create a test directory: `test-output`
     - Create a test file with some content
     - Read and modify the file
     - Use MCP filesystem if available
   - Expected outcome:
     - Working directory with test files
     - Demonstrated file operations
   - Time estimate: 15 minutes

3. **Document Setup**
   - Requirements:
     - Create a SETUP_STATUS.md file
     - List what's working and what's not
     - Note any permission issues encountered
   - Expected outcome:
     - Clear documentation of current state
   - Time estimate: 15 minutes

## Rules & Constraints
- Work in the current directory
- Log all operations
- If you encounter permission prompts, note them
- Create a summary at the end

## Session Goals
This is a test session to verify the automation setup is working correctly.

## Session Instructions

1. **MCP Servers**: First run `/mcp` to check available MCP servers
2. **Work Directory**: You're in /Users/abhishek/Work/claude-automation
3. **Progress Logging**: Create PROGRESS.md and update it every 15 minutes
4. **File Operations**: Use the filesystem MCP server when available

## Required Outputs

Create these files during your session:

1. **PROGRESS.md** - Update every 15 minutes with:
   - Current time
   - Tasks completed
   - Current task in progress
   - Any blockers

2. **SUMMARY.md** - At session end with:
   - List of all completed tasks
   - Files created/modified
   - Any issues encountered
   - Recommendations for next session

## Important Notes

- This is an autonomous session. Work independently.
- If you encounter permission prompts, note them in ISSUES.md
- Create a git commit after each major task (if in git repo)
- Test your code after implementation

Begin work now. Your session ends at Thu Jun  5 06:10:29 IST 2025.
