# Setup Status Report

## Test Date: Monday, January 6, 2025

### Overview
This document summarizes the current state of the Claude automation testing setup.

## What's Working

### ✅ File Operations
- **Basic file creation**: Successfully created test-output directory
- **File writing**: Created test-file.txt with initial content
- **File reading**: Successfully read file contents using Read tool
- **File editing**: Successfully modified file using Edit tool
- **Directory listing**: Successfully listed directory contents

### ✅ Script Access
- Multiple shell scripts available in repository
- Permission scripts appear to be in place
- MCP server implementation file (mcp-smart-ops.js) exists

### ✅ Documentation Tools
- Successfully created and updated PROGRESS.md
- Successfully updated ISSUES.md
- File editing and creation workflows functioning

## What's Not Working

### ❌ MCP Server Direct Testing
- **Issue**: `/mcp` command not available as bash command
- **Details**: The `/mcp` command appears to be Claude Code specific, not a system command
- **Impact**: Cannot directly test MCP server functionality through command line
- **Workaround**: Found MCP-related configuration files and scripts

## Permission Issues Encountered
- None during this session
- All file operations completed without permission prompts
- Test directory and files created successfully

## Current Environment
- **Working Directory**: /Users/abhishek/Work/claude-automation
- **Platform**: macOS
- **File System Access**: Full read/write access confirmed
- **Script Execution**: Bash commands working normally

## Recommendations
1. Investigate Claude Code specific MCP testing methods
2. File operations are fully functional for automation tasks
3. Current setup supports basic automation workflows
4. Consider testing MCP servers through Claude Code interface rather than bash

## Files Created This Session
- test-output/test-file.txt - Test file with modifications
- SETUP_STATUS.md - This status document
- Updated PROGRESS.md and ISSUES.md

## Summary
The automation setup is largely functional with excellent file operation capabilities. The only limitation is direct MCP server testing through command line, which may require Claude Code specific approaches.
