# Multi-Claude Collaboration Without APIs 🤝

This guide shows you how to run multiple Claude instances collaborating on your code WITHOUT using expensive APIs. Instead, we use the desktop apps you already have!

## 🎯 The Secret: File-Based Communication

Instead of APIs, the Claudes communicate through shared files:
- Task assignments
- Code handoffs  
- Review feedback
- Test results

## 🚀 Setup (One Time)

```bash
cd /Users/abhishek/Work/claude-automation
./setup-collaboration.sh
```

This creates the collaboration workspace with:
- Shared context files
- Task queues
- Handoff directories
- Review systems

## 🤖 The Team

### 1. Developer Claude (Claude Code Terminal)
- Your main Claude Max subscription
- Runs in terminal with `claude` command
- Writes the actual code
- Has full MCP server access

### 2. Reviewer Claude (Claude Desktop App)  
- Same Claude Max subscription
- Runs in the desktop app
- Reviews code quality
- Provides feedback through files

### 3. Tester AI (Google AI Studio - FREE!)
- Uses Google's Gemini (completely free)
- Generates comprehensive tests
- No API key needed
- Access at: https://aistudio.google.com

### 4. Documentation AI (ChatGPT Desktop)
- Your ChatGPT Plus subscription
- Generates documentation
- No API usage

## 📋 Workflow Example

### Step 1: Split Tasks
```bash
# Create your master task file
cat > collaboration/tasks/todays-work.md << 'EOF'
## ROLE: developer
## TASK: Implement user authentication
- Create login/logout endpoints
- Add JWT token handling
- Implement password hashing

## ROLE: reviewer
## TASK: Review authentication code
- Check security vulnerabilities
- Verify best practices
- Review error handling

## ROLE: tester  
## TASK: Test authentication
- Create unit tests
- Test edge cases
- Integration tests

## ROLE: documenter
## TASK: Document auth system
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Security notes
EOF

# Split into individual tasks
node collaboration/split-tasks.js collaboration/tasks/todays-work.md
```

### Step 2: Launch Developer Claude
```bash
./collaboration/launch-developer.sh
```

Developer Claude will:
1. Read its tasks from `tasks/developer-tasks.md`
2. Write code
3. Create handoff file when done: `handoff/ready-for-review-[timestamp].md`

### Step 3: Launch Reviewer Claude (Desktop)
```bash
./collaboration/launch-reviewer.sh
```

This opens Claude Desktop with review instructions. The reviewer:
1. Monitors `handoff/ready-for-review-*.md`
2. Reviews the code
3. Writes feedback to `reviews/feedback-[timestamp].md`

### Step 4: Launch Tester (Google AI Studio)
```bash
./collaboration/launch-tester-aistudio.sh
```

1. Opens AI Studio in browser
2. Copy the generated prompt
3. Upload code files from handoff directory
4. Get comprehensive tests generated for FREE

### Step 5: Documentation (ChatGPT Desktop)
Simply open ChatGPT desktop app and give it:
```
Please document this code: [paste code or drag files]
Generate:
1. API documentation
2. Usage examples  
3. Architecture overview
```

## 🔄 Automatic Handoffs

The file watcher automatically notifies when handoffs are ready:

```bash
# In a separate terminal
node collaboration/watch-handoffs.js
```

This will:
- Watch for new handoff files
- Show desktop notifications
- Play alert sounds

## 📁 Communication Structure

```
collaboration/
├── shared-context/
│   └── CONTEXT.md          # Project overview all Claudes read
├── tasks/
│   ├── developer-tasks.md  # Developer's work queue
│   ├── reviewer-tasks.md   # Reviewer's queue
│   └── tester-tasks.md     # Tester's queue
├── handoff/
│   ├── ready-for-review-*.md
│   ├── ready-for-testing-*.md
│   └── CURRENT_WORK.md     # Real-time status
└── reviews/
    ├── feedback-*.md       # Review feedback
    └── approved-*.md       # Approved code
```

## 🎮 Orchestration

Run everything from one command:

```bash
./collaboration/orchestrate.sh
```

This:
1. Starts the file watcher
2. Launches Developer Claude
3. Opens tmux session for monitoring
4. Shows instructions for launching other instances

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### Traditional API Approach
- Claude API: $15-75 per million tokens
- GPT-4 API: $30-60 per million tokens  
- 4-hour session: ~$50-100

### Our Desktop App Approach
- Claude Max: $20/month (unlimited)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month (unlimited)
- Google AI Studio: FREE
- **Total for unlimited usage: $40/month**

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### 1. Structured Handoffs
Create clear handoff templates:

```markdown
# Code Ready for Review

## Branch: feature/user-auth
## Files Modified:
- src/auth/login.js
- src/auth/middleware.js
- tests/auth.test.js

## Changes Made:
1. Implemented JWT authentication
2. Added password hashing with bcrypt
3. Created login/logout endpoints

## Testing:
- All tests passing
- 85% code coverage

## Questions for Reviewer:
- Is the token expiry time appropriate?
- Should we add rate limiting?
```

### 2. Parallel Work
While Developer Claude works on Task A, have:
- Reviewer Claude reviewing previous work
- Tester AI generating tests for completed features
- Documentation being updated

### 3. Context Persistence
Keep shared context updated:

```bash
# Update after each session
cat >> collaboration/shared-context/CONTEXT.md << 'EOF'

## Session 2024-01-05
- Completed: User authentication
- In Progress: User profiles  
- Next: Permission system
EOF
```

### 4. Quick Commands

Add to your aliases:

```bash
# Quick collaboration commands
alias claude-dev="./collaboration/launch-developer.sh"
alias claude-review="./collaboration/launch-reviewer.sh"
alias claude-test="./collaboration/launch-tester-aistudio.sh"
alias claude-watch="node collaboration/watch-handoffs.js"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Claudes not seeing updates?
- Make sure file watcher is running
- Check file permissions
- Refresh Claude's context with: "Check for new handoff files"

### Desktop app not responding?
- Use AppleScript to automate:
```applescript
tell application "Claude"
    activate
    -- Your automation here
end tell
```

### Want more automation?
- Use Keyboard Maestro or similar tools
- Set up Shortcuts on macOS
- Use cron jobs for periodic checks

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **No API Costs**: Use your existing subscriptions
2. **Unlimited Usage**: No token limits

5. **Easy Debugging**: Watch the collaboration in real-time

## Example Session

```bash
# Morning: Set up work
./collaboration/orchestrate.sh
claude-task  # Create tasks
node collaboration/split-tasks.js

# Let them work
# Developer Claude: 2 hours coding
# Reviewer Claude: Reviews when ready  
# Tester AI: Generates tests
# You: Coffee break ☕

# Afternoon: Check results
cat collaboration/reviews/feedback-*.md
cat collaboration/reviews/test-report-*.md

# Merge the PR!
```

This approach gives you a full AI development team for the price of a couple of subscriptions! 🚀
