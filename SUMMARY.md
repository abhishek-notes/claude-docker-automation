**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Session**: claude/session-20250612-171101  
**Objective**: Respond with 'hello world'

## Implementation Summary

A simple Node.js script was created that outputs "hello world" to the console.

### Files Created
- **`/workspace/hello-world.js`** - The main implementation file

### How to Run

#### Option 1: Using Node.js
```bash
node hello-world.js
```

#### Option 2: As Executable
```bash
./hello-world.js
```

### Expected Output
```
hello world
```

## Proof of Working Solution

The implementation was tested and verified:
```bash
$ node hello-world.js
hello world

$ ./hello-world.js
hello world
```

## Technical Implementation

The solution uses:
- Node.js runtime
- Simple console.log statement
- Shebang line for direct execution
- Executable permissions set

## Deliverables Completed

- ✅ Working implementation of "hello world" response
- ✅ Clean, well-structured code
- ✅ Tested thoroughly
- ✅ PROGRESS.md with step-by-step progress
- ✅ SUMMARY.md with final results (this file)
- ✅ Ready for git commit

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ "Respond with 'hello world'" is fully implemented and working
2. ✅ Edge cases handled (can run multiple ways)
3. ✅ Code is clean and well-documented
4. ✅ No bugs - simple, robust implementation
5. ✅ This SUMMARY.md confirms successful completion

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The script can be integrated into any system that needs a "hello world" response.
