# Claude Docker Automation - Restored Working Version

## Summary

I've successfully restored the previous working versions of the claude-docker-automation scripts from the backup created on 2025-06-07. The current versions had been significantly simplified and lost critical functionality, including proper session ID handling.

## Restored Files

1. **`claude-direct-task-restored.sh`** - The working version of the direct task injection script
   - Restored from: `backups/claude-docker-automation-pre-task-20250607-145821/claude-direct-task.sh`
   - Features restored:
     - Proper session ID generation
     - Comprehensive task prompting
     - Git workflow instructions
     - Docker container management
     - Both copy-paste and auto-paste modes

2. **`claude-terminal-launcher-restored.sh`** - The working terminal launcher with AppleScript automation
   - Restored from: `backups/claude-docker-automation-pre-task-20250607-145821/claude-terminal-launcher.sh`
   - Features restored:
     - Integration with safety-system.sh
     - Proper session tracking
     - AppleScript automation for Terminal.app
     - Task content injection

3. **`safety-system-restored.sh`** - The safety and backup system
   - Restored from: `backups/claude-docker-automation-pre-task-20250607-145821/safety-system.sh`
   - Features restored:
     - Pre-task backup creation
     - Session tracking
     - Logging functionality

4. **`claude-official-restored.sh`** - The official Claude launcher (referenced in direct-task)
   - Restored from: `backups/claude-docker-automation-pre-task-20250607-145821/archive/alternative-scripts/claude-official.sh`

## Key Differences from Current Version

The current simplified versions had:
- Lost the session ID generation logic
- Removed the comprehensive task instructions
- Simplified to basic Docker run commands
- Lost the safety system integration
- Lost the auto-paste functionality

## Usage

To use the restored working versions:

```bash
# For direct task injection (copy-paste mode):
./claude-direct-task-restored.sh /path/to/project CLAUDE_TASKS.md

# For terminal launcher with automation:
./claude-terminal-launcher-restored.sh /path/to/project CLAUDE_TASKS.md

# For manual Claude session:
./claude-official-restored.sh start /path/to/project
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Session ID Issue**: The original version properly generates session IDs using `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`
2. **Task Injection**: Full task content is properly formatted and injected
3. **Safety Features**: Backup creation and session tracking restored
4. **Git Workflow**: Proper branch creation and commit instructions included
5. **Docker Management**: Proper container naming and lifecycle management

## Recommendation

Use the restored versions for proper terminal automation functionality. The simplified versions currently in use have lost too much critical functionality to work properly with the automation system.
