You are Claude Code working in a Docker container. I need you to complete the tasks defined in CLAUDE_TASKS.md.

TASK CONTENT FROM CLAUDE_TASKS.md:

WORKING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a feature branch: claude/session-session-20250609-191150 from main branch
2. Work systematically through EACH task listed above until completion
3. Create PROGRESS.md and update it after completing each major task
4. Commit changes frequently with meaningful messages
5. Test everything thoroughly as you build
6. Create comprehensive SUMMARY.md when ALL tasks are complete
7. Document any issues in ISSUES.md
