## Success Criteria
The task is complete when:
1. Help me solve my issue in this chat file in work directory: extracted (2).txt and extracted (3).txt -- i am super frustrated now, just get it done, no matter what tests you write etc. -- do it in iterm is fully implemented and working
2. All edge cases are handled
3. Code is clean and well-documented
4. No critical bugs remain
5. SUMMARY.md confirms successful completion

Start by analyzing the project structure, then implement the features systematically.
